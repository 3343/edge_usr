Assets
======
EDGE provides assets, for example, binary input, in a :edge_opt:`separate repository <>`
Due to limitations of git, when it comes to large files, we use
`Git Large File Storage <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_ (Git LFS) in this repository.
To use EDGE's assets repository, install the Git LFS command-line client by following the linked instructions.
Futher background information and documentation on Git LFS is available from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs.

Obtaining Data
--------------
* Be aware that the entire repository contains LFS pointers to data in the size of >100GB.
  If you are not planning on storing all of this, follow the instructions below.
* The best performance, when cloning :edge_opt:`EDGE's assets repository <>`, is obtained by using ``git lfs clone``. This will download all, possibly large, files stored in the Git LFS store.
* If you are only interested in certain files or directories, you can, by using ``git lfs clone --exclude=*``, initialize the assets repository with non-LFS files and Git LFS pointers only.
  Now, to obtain only a certain file or directories, use ``git lfs fetch`` with the arguments ``-I`` and ``-X``. For example ``git lfs fetch -I test/*`` would download all files and directories in the directory ``test``.
  After downloading the files from the remote Git LFS store, you can replace the Git LFS pointers in your local Git repository with the actual files through ``git lfs checkout test/*``.
