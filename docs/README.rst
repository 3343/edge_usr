Introduction
============
Hey there, you have reached the user guide of the Extreme-scale Discontinuous Galerkin Environment (EDGE).
EDGE uses the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG-) Finite Element Method (FEM) to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations.
EDGE supports different equations and element types.

Currently, the application's focus is on seismic simulations using unstructured tetrahedral meshes.
EDGE targets seismic model setups with high geometric complexity and extreme-scale ensemble simulations.
The entire software stack is uniquely tailored to "fused" simulations.
Fused simulations allow for different model setups within one execution of the forward solver.
For example, you could share the mesh and velocity model in the fused runs, but alter the kinematic source from run to run.
This approach allows the code to exploit inter-simulation parallelism and reach significantly higher simulation throughput.
Typically, the speedup is around 2-5 times, depending on the configuration.
In short: Fusing simulations makes the code faster.

EDGE is distributed across different resources.
First of all, there is this user guide you are reading currently.
The main purpose of the user guide is to guide you through the installation of the code and the setup of simulations.
If you run into trouble, don't hesitate to get in touch.
This user guide's issue tracker is available at :edge_usr_git:`issues`, the issue tracker of the code at :edge_git:`issues`.

The next resource is the :edge_git:`software <>` itself.
EDGE only provides source code, which is nice because you can always look at the guts of the software.
However, it requires you to go through the compilation yourself.
Then there are the :edge_opt:`assets <>`, which are example setups, and supporting scripts and data.
For example, this is the place where setups for benchmarks and unit tests are hosted.
Finally, EDGE's :dial3343:`homepage <>` provides up-to-date information on the Extreme-scale Discontinuous Galerkin Environment.
To reach any of EDGE's other resources, consider using the :dial3343:`dispatcher <dispatcher>`
